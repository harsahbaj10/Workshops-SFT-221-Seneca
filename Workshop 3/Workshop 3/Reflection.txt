To test that the function for gathering customer information properly handles blank lines, one approach could be to intentionally create a blank line as input for the prompts and then check if the program issues the correct prompt for invalid input. This can be done by running the program in a debugging environment and checking the output, or by adding print statements to the code to print the prompts and invalid input messages.Another approach could be to use automated testing tools such as unit tests to check if the program produces the correct output for a given input. This way you could test multiple inputs and check the output in one go. Additionally, you could also use test-driven development, where you write test cases before writing the actual implementation, this way you can ensure that the code behaves as expected.
